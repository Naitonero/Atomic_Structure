	<h2>
	Atom
	</h2>
	<p>
	An atom is a particle of matter that defines and represents a chemical element. An atom consists of a nucleus (located in the center of the structure) that is surrounded by one or more negatively charged electrons. The nucleus is positively charged and contains one or more relatively heavy particles known as protons and neutrons.
	</p>
	<h2>
	Electron
	</h2>
	<p>
	Electrons are  subatomic particles with a negative electric charge. Fun Fact Electrons : belong to the first generation of the lepton particle family, and are generally thought to be elementary particles because they have no known components or substructure.
	</P>
	<h2>
	Proton
	</h2>
	<p>
	Protons are charged postivly and are particles which are present in the nucleus of an atom. An atom is composed of protons, electrons, and neutrons. The entire mass of an atom is concentrated in the nucleus which is at the centre. The nucleus contains protons and neutrons which are collectively called nucleons.
	</p>
	<h2>
	Neutron
	</h2>
	<p>
	A neutron is an uncharged (electrically neutral) subatomic particle with mass 1,839 times that of the electron(Heavies subatomic partic even though no charges). Neutrons are stable when bound in an atomic nucleus.
