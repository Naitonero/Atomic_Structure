	The atom structure of elements in the periodic table
	</h1>
	<h2>
	Nucleus
	</h2>
	<p>
	The nucleus is one of the main parts of the atomic located in the center of the structure structure consisiting of neutrons and protons.
	</p>
	<h2>
	Cloud/Electron orbit
	</h2>
	<p>
	The cloud or in other terms the electron orbit is around the nucleus consisting of electron orbiting.
	</p>
	<h2>
	How elements define an atom structure.
	</h2>
	<p>
	Elements are very pure substances with detailed spacefic properties and features beyond  atoms including the fact that atoms are the tiniest units IN THE ELEMENT ech type of an element has a unique structure that retains exactly what the element is.
	<p>
	<h2>
	What is a periodic table
	</h2>
	<p>
	The periodic table (periodic table of elements)arranges and classifies elementsinto rows ("periods") and columns ("groups").
	</p>
	<h2>
	Isotopes
	</h2>
	<p>
	Isotopes are members of a family of an element that all have the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons.

	<h2>CHEMISTRY FUN FACTS</h2>
	<p>1-A total of !!!118!!! elements make up the periodic table.</p>
	<p>2-The laziest gas is a noble gases which is in the air and never conducts negative nor positive energy,</p>
	<p>3-The most energetic type of gas is helium because of it ionization.</p>
